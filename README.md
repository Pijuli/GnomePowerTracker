## GNOME PowerTracker
GNOME PowerTracker is a simple application that helps users monitor their power consumption on GNOME-based systems.

- Does not use any dependency
- Autodetects battery (BAT0, BAT1, BATT: /sys/class/power_supply)
- You can configure refresh rate

IMPORTANT.
- This will only work with laptops. Afaik there's no simple way to track desktop power consumption
- Power when fully charged is 0W
- Power when charging has a plus sign
- Power when discharging has a minus sign

If you have any issue, please report it so I can take a look at it!
Enjoy!
